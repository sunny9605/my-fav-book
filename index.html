      Yuval Noah Harari begins Sapiens at the very beginning of the universe
      known as the Big Bang. Scientists say that basic aspects of the universe
      including matter, energy, time, and space started about 14 billion years
      ago. Organisms emerged 4 billion years ago. The relatively short period of
      70,000 years ago represents all of human history and culture. The author
      outlines the three revolutions that form the core of his treatment of the
      history of humankind. The Cognitive Revolution "kick-started history about
      70,000 years ago." The Agricultural Revolution that took place about
      12,000 years ago had an accelerating effect on the development of human
      history with the development of farming. The Scientific Revolution of
      about 500 years ago changed humankind's relationship to the world through
      the understanding of basing knowledge on evidence. Harari notes that
      "animals much like modern humans" came into existence about 2.5 million
      years ago. For a long time, they "did not stand out from the myriad other
      organisms" living on Earth. The species Homo sapiens belongs to a
      "particularly noisy family called the great apes" although Harari argues
      that many people do not want to recognize their relation to the rest of
      the animal kingdom. Homo sapiens or "wise man" emerged as the only human
      species after either intermarrying with or killing off Homo
      neanderthalensis or "Neander Valley man" and other human species. The
      Neander Valley where Homo neanderthalensis was first found is in Germany.
      Throughout the book Harari calls Homo sapiens by their species name or
      simply as Sapiens. Harari states that between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago,
      Homo sapiens developed "new ways of thinking and communicating" defined as
      the Cognitive Revolution. The development of language is a central part of
      the Cognitive Revolution. Scientists believe that language developed for
      one of two reasons. Language may have developed out of people's need to
      communicate danger such as a predator lurking nearby. Harari calls this
      idea the "there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory." Another reason language
      developed may have been to express who can and cannot be trusted in a
      group. Harari calls the second explanation for the emergence of human
      language "the gossip theory." According to Harari the most critical
      creation of the Cognitive Revolution was fiction. Harari argues that the
      ability to cooperate in large groups is based on shared beliefs in ideas.
      Harari emphasizes the importance of the fact that "large numbers of
      strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths." This
      ability led to the eventual founding of large-scale cooperative human
      activities such as founding cities and building empires.

      According to Yuval Noah Harari, human nature can be best understood by
      looking at the lives of "our hunter-gatherer ancestors." Sapiens'
      lifestyle revolved around foraging and hunting for food sources for "tens
      of thousands of years." This lifestyle is understood by "the flourishing
      field of evolutionary psychology" to have shaped human traits because
      humans lived in this way for so long. Harari explains that people's
      understanding of the lives of hunter-gatherers is based on "flimsy
      evidence" because they pre-date writing. Most items they used were made of
      wood and did not last. In general hunter-gatherers did not possess a lot
      of items at all. Dogs were the only animal domesticated by people before
      the Agricultural Revolution according to Harari. He describes dogs'
      relationship with humans as based on a "15,000-year bond." Dogs and humans
      "co-evolved to communicate well with each other" as dogs helped with
      hunting, fighting, warning, and other tasks. Harari describes the wealth
      of knowledge and skills that "the average ancient forager" possessed. In
      these times foragers knew how to quickly create a spear point from a
      stone. Foragers understood every detail of their environment. They learned
      to control "the internal world of their own bodies and senses" as they
      survived in nature alongside other animals. People in these times had
      impressive "physical dexterity" and were "as fit as marathon runners"
      according to Harari. Hunter-gatherers also had better health and more
      varied diets than people who lived after them. Hunter-gatherers also had
      spiritual lives according to Harari. He states that "we have only the
      haziest notions about the religion of ancient foragers." According to
      Harari scholars agree that early religious beliefs were animist or based
      on the idea that "every place, every animal, every plant and every natural
      phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate directly with
      humans." The Cognitive Revolution which emerged in about 70,000 BCE led to
      the Sapiens' expansion according to Harari. He describes how about 45,000
      years ago, Sapiens living in Asia "developed the first seafaring society."
      The Sapiens were able to expand into Australia which had a completely
      different ecosystem untouched by humans. Harari states that the appearance
      of humans led to the disappearance of the majority of animal species in
      Australia. Scientists believe this could be due to humans' agricultural
      burning techniques, hunting, climate change, or a combination of these
      factors. In any case these Australian extinctions represent "the first
      significant mark Homo sapiens left on our planet."

      Yuval Noah Harari states that about 10,000 years ago, Sapiens stopped
      focusing on foraging and "began to devote almost all their time and effort
      to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species." For example
      humans domesticated plants like wheat by about 9000 BCE, peas in 8000 BCE,
      olive trees by 5000 BCE, and grapevines in 3500 BCE. Animals were also
      domesticated which included goats by 9000 BCE and horses by 4000 BCE. The
      Agricultural Revolution began in the Middle East around 9000 BCE, but
      "scholars agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world."
      Other independent examples of the development of agriculture include China
      in 6000 BCE and Central America in 4500 BCE. According to Harari humans
      developed agriculture only in the locations where the few species of
      plants and animals that "were suitable candidates for farming and herding"
      could thrive. While hunter-gatherers could choose from a wide variety of
      natural plants and animals for their diet, the Agricultural Revolution was
      based on a much narrower diet of what can be grown and raised. Harari
      argues that "there is no evidence that people became more intelligent with
      time." On the contrary the "secrets of nature" known to the average
      forager were forgotten as the Agricultural Revolution transformed human
      life. The author refers to the Agricultural Revolution as "history's
      biggest fraud" because he argues that it tricked humankind into arranging
      itself around unnatural and harmful ways of life. Harari notes that
      farmers hoped to store food so that they could have a surplus for times of
      scarcity. The extra food did not help the majority of people. Instead, the
      surplus of food led to "population explosions and pampered elites."
      Farmers worked harder than foragers but had less enjoyment and a less
      healthy diet that was centered on crops like wheat, rice, and potatoes.
      When these central crops had issues due to weather or disease, the entire
      population of people could starve. The domestication of animals led to the
      creation of a new type of society "based primarily on the exploitation of
      animals" by herders. Harari notes that domesticated animals became the
      most widespread mammals in the world, but their lives are miserable.
      Animals are forced to live in ways that are against their desires and
      nature. Harari notes that for humans to domesticate animals, they had to
      oppress animals' instincts, social relationships, sexual urges, and the
      ability to move freely. According to Harari the processes involved with
      the domestication of animals have only gotten worse over time. During the
      foraging times, humankind lived in bands according to Harari. Hundreds of
      people could cooperate toward goals. In the agricultural era, many more
      people were able to cooperate based on the strength of shared myths. The
      emergence of empires demonstrated the human imagination's ability to
      create ideas that bound people together toward a common purpose. Harari
      shares examples of early societies like the first Egyptian kingdom in 3100
      BCE and the Akkadian Empire which was formed around 2250 BCE. Mega-empires
      like the Babylonian and Persian empires thrived from about 1000 BCE to 500
      BCE. Other empires like the Qin in China and the Roman Empire governed
      millions of people. These empires were all possible because of humankind's
      unique ability to create "astounding networks of mass cooperation."
      According to Harari these "human cooperation networks" are not oriented
      toward justice and equality. Instead, most of them "have been geared
      towards oppression and exploitation." Suffering peasants and enriched
      elites have been part of almost all "human cooperation networks" or
      societies according to Harari. Social distinctions giving more rights to
      one group than another are often foundational in society.

      Yuval Noah Harari details the development of mathematics which allowed
      humankind to handle more information than their memories could. Societies
      developed ways for people to record information because "the human brain
      is not a good storage device for empire-sized databases." Numbers played a
      central role in the development of human society. The development of
      writing started with "facts and figures" related to exchanges of goods.
      The first written records of humankind dealt with financial deals about
      grain. Numbers are now "the world's dominant language" in Harari's
      telling. Harari argues that "all societies are based on imagined
      hierarchies" that classify people according to different aspects such as
      religion, ethnicity, or gender. While there are differences in how this
      plays out from society to society, Harari notes that "concepts of
      pollution and purity" often contribute to a society's classification of
      people. He connects these concepts to the caste system in India and the
      racist policies and actions of the United States during the era of
      segregation and beyond. Harari examines the reasons for and history of why
      "patriarchy has been the norm in almost all agricultural and industrial
      societies." He details theories like men having more muscle strength or
      aggression than women. Another "biological explanation" holds that men and
      women evolved differently based on "survival and reproduction strategies."
      This theory states that men needed to compete, and women needed to work
      with men and with other women to survive during pregnancy and to help
      raise their children. Harari argues that the research on this topic has
      provided "no good answer" about the widespread prevalence of patriarchy.

    <p>
      Yuval Noah Harari defines culture as a "network of artificial instincts"
      created by people to help "millions of strangers cooperate effectively."
      People learn how to function and think through the "myths and fictions"
      that tie society together. The author states that in the past, historians
      thought that cultures were "complete and harmonious." Historians believed
      that cultures had an "unchanging essence" and would not change
      significantly over time. Harari notes that those who study cultures today
      understand that while cultures do have central practices and values, these
      aspects of culture "are in constant flux." Many cultures are based on
      contradictions that will never be resolved according to Harari. For
      example Harari argues that in medieval times, Europeans faced a tension
      between Christianity and chivalry. Christianity asked for peaceful and
      empathetic behavior while chivalry demanded loyalty to lords and the need
      to fight others. Harari states that the tension or conflict between
      liberty and equality is central to humankind in modern societies. Harari
      argues that "such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human
      culture." Harari notes that people have a difficult time deciding whether
      the events of history follow "some overall pattern" or direction. His
      answer is yes. Cultures and civilizations tend to come together and to
      expand into larger ones. Some cultures and civilizations split or fall,
      but such events "are temporary reversals in an inexorable trend towards
      unity. The author discusses the development of the concept and use of
      money as cities and civilizations expanded. Hunter-gatherers did not use
      money, and the small farming communities that preceded city life had
      little use for the concept as well according to Harari. People needed to
      move beyond bartering goods and standardize the values of goods and
      services. Harari defines money as "a universal medium of exchange that
      enables people to convert almost everything into almost anything else."
      Harari argues that money's "darker side" is that it encourages people to
      trust in the money system but not in each other. During the bartering era,
      people had to trust each other in an economic transaction, but this trust
      is applied solely to money in the modern era according to the author.
